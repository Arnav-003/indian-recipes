<h3>How to make Tandoori Chicken</h3>
    <h4><em>Steps</em></h4>
<ol>
    <li><h4><em>Prepare the marinade for Tandoori Chicken</em></h4>
        <img class="Tandoori_chicken-1" src="../images/Ingredients.jpeg" alt="Image of Ingredients">
        <p>To make your very own tandoori chicken recipe, take the chicken, wash nicely and pat dry. Cut the chicken in pieces. To prepare the marinade, take a large bowl and mix together yoghurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, red chilli powder, turmeric, cumin powder, black pepper powder, coriander powder, garam masala, kasoori methi powder, mustard oil and salt to taste. Coat the chicken very well in this marinade and place it in the refrigerator. Let the chicken marinate for 8-10 hours. Once marinated, let it sit in the room temperature for an hour before continuing with the further steps. Meanwhile, preheat the oven at 200 degrees Celsius.</p>
    </li>
    <li><h4><em> Bake the marinated chicken for 45-50 minutes</em></h4>

            <p>Next, take a baking tray and put aluminium foil on it, then keep a drip tray on top of this baking tray. Put the marinated chicken on this tray and sprinkle a little cornflour on top of these marinated chicken pieces. Place the tray in the oven and bake for 45-50 minutes. Make sure to turn the chicken pieces in between.</p>
    </li>
    <li><h4><em> Serve Tandoori Chicken with green chutney</em></h4>

            <p>When you take them out, they should be crispy and cooked thoroughly. Let the chicken pieces stay in the oven for 10 minutes more even after it has been turned off. Your Tandoori Chicken is ready! Serve with green chutney.</p>

<h3>Tips</h3>
<ul>
    <li>If you have a tandoor, you can also grill the chicken pieces in it for an authentic taste.</li>
    <li>You can baste the chicken pieces with ghee or butter for an added flavour. Skip if you want to keep the recipe low-fat.</li>
    <li>Do not use curd with the whey water. Try using hung curd for marination.</li>
    <li>You can also take chicken thighs or breasts for making this dish.</li>
