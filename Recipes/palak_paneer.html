    <h3>How to make Palak Paneer</h3>
    <h4><em>Steps</em></h4>
<ol>
    <li><h4><em>Wash and boil the spinach for Palak Panee</em></h4>
        <img class="palak-paneer-1" src="../images/washing palak.jpg" alt="Image of Washing Palak">
        <p>To make the paneer soft, soak it in water for some time. Cut the paneer into small cubes and keep it aside. To ensure that the spinach is adulterant-free, soak it in water and add a small pinch of salt. Then clean and wash spinach thoroughly. Now, put a deep-bottomed pan over medium flame and add spinach in it. Cover and cook until the spinach becomes soft and mushy. You need not add any water as spinach gets cooked in its own water. Once cooked, take 100 grams of spinach and chop it well in a bowl. Afterwards, puree the remaining spinach and keep it aside. (Note: You can blanch the spinach as well.)</p>
    </li>
    <li><h4><em>Cook the spinach puree with spices</em></h4>

            <p>Now, put a pan over medium flame and melt ghee in it. Add cumin seeds in it along with halved whole red chilli. Let them temper for a few seconds and then add garlic, onion, green chilli, ginger. Saute well and then add coriander powder, cumin powder, kasoori methi powder and salt. Mix well and cook for 2 minutes. Finally, add cream and pureed spinach and cook for 2-3 minutes.</p>
    </li>

<h3>Tips</h3>
<ul>
    <li>For making Palak Paneer at home, use fresh spinach leaves instead of blanched ones. It has more nutrients than the one which is blanched.</li>
    <li>To maintain that green colour of your Palak Paneer, make sure you use a little less garam masala powder as it brings a little brown colour to any dish.</li>
    <li>For a silky smooth flavour in your Palak Paneer, you can add the puree of cashews or almonds (1-2 tsp) while cooking.</li>
    <li>Try to use Homemade Paneer for this recipe as it would bring a freshness to your dish along with a smooth flavour.</li>
    <li>Always soak the store-bought paneer for 20-30 minutes in warm water.</li>
</ul>
